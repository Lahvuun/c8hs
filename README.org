* CHIP-8 emulator in Haskell
- Some demos and games work.
- Input doesn't work.

Having to convert between different integer types made we think it would be better to store everything in ~Int~ and siumlate ~Word8~ and ~Word16~ overflow/underflow on arithmetic operations. ~Int~ and not ~Integer~ because ~Int~ is used for indexing in the vector library I picked. Maybe ~Integer~ could work if the library used ~Ix~.
